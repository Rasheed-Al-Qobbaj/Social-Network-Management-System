# Social Network Management System

A **Java-based application** designed to manage and operate a social network. This project emphasizes the use of **linked lists built entirely from scratch**, without relying on external libraries or frameworks for data structures. The only external library used is **JavaFX** for the user interface.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, and manage user profiles.
- **Connections**: Add and manage connections between users.
- **Interactions**: Support for user posts, messages, and other interactions.
- **Custom Linked List Implementation**: All underlying data structures are implemented using a custom-built linked list for educational purposes.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a growing number of users and connections efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **UI Library**: JavaFX
- **Custom Data Structures**: Fully implemented linked lists from scratch.
